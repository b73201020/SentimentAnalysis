		'too many ads good app bit is it really nessicary to have an ad or 2 every other song when i used iheart radeo you just needed to watch one ad in the beginning and thats it would give 4 5 stars if there wasnt so many ads'
		'ads upon ads pandora is a generally cool service but it isnt for everyone music library is limited playlists or radio stations as theyre called here are repetitive and ads so many ads its hard to get off the bandwagon because pandora does occasionally deliver on its promise to help you discover new music plus its free but for me uninstalling this app was an inevitability '
		'good vs bad bad the free version will only let you skip so many songs and then youre forced to listen to whatevers on also there are ads and pop ups everywhere and i usually dont notice ads or care when i see them suggesting that you go add free after getting so sick of seeing the ads i clicked on the option to pay and found out that its on a monthly basis not an ad free app good the music is good and varied and they even have non mainstream artists indie available to listen to EXCLAMATION '

		'poor look the apps great i absolutely love pandora but god im bout tired of the commercials i can deal with a few but they interrupt the flow more than an actual fm radio station i suggest to use another online radio until they calm down with commercials other than that good music good quality an overall solid app and experience '
