Anyway, I would like to request a \"Night Mode,\" or something similar. I believe the app used to have something like that. If I remember correctly, it did it automatically with the screen dimming. I really like having a dark UI for when I'm driving at night, it is much easier on the eyes and is safer. This is one of the main reasons I use Slacker. Daytime - Pandora, Nighttime - Slacker.  Also, the newest update requires you to return to the \"home\" screen to be able to get to the \"quit\" menu item. I would love for it to be back in the menu for the \"Now Playing\" screen. Makes it much easier to exit the app. Anyway, keep up the great work. I love Pandora's algorithm.
