The next day, I installed the app, logged in to the service and *tried* to download my book. It wasn't there. Digging around on the mobile app, I found that I was in an account from 2009 that I wasn't even aware of, weird. But my login from a browser always took me to the account with my book purchase. So I emailed Audible's customer service.  Emailing Audible's customer service is a waste of time. The information I got back made absolutely no sense. I eventually achieved a result with 2 calls to Audible customer service (in addition to the email).  Then I went to cancel my service. That went well as they offered me 50% off for 3 months. Then it went south by resetting the 26 day old timer for my next download. I let this simmer for a few days (wishfully) thinking it would resolve itself. It didn't, so I called Audible again.  This contact didn't go smooth at all. I was advised that my payment had been declined. Weird as I haven't had trouble with any of my cards. So I asked to speak with a supervisor. I was told one wasn't available. Unacceptable.

The latest update has certainly improved the UI which I was rather scathing of in a previous review. Overall the changes are for the better, but there is still two major issues with this app. A Foreground Service is the correct way to ensure playback while the app is not running. However the Foreground Service should not stay running when playback is stopped or paused. Secondly, the Service periodically crashes and requires me to open the Audible app and re-enter my login credentials in order to continue playback. This makes it impossible to use whilst driving which is my main use, and I'll be forced to cancel my subscription unless this issue is fixed soon.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1377017385233,"rating":1,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOE3CZGTNBGB56UHVbUChShnoHzrLdK8xDZELYZ0YVJoVQuTSQVxGb_TFLqFeSTSHAS0fFmWGTSyHchiETY"},{"text":"Too much security!\tApp requires password entry far too often.

The new UI appears to follow modern Android design guidelines if you only look at screenshots but Audible still has a ways to go before this is a well-behaved Android app.  Audible starts four foreground services on your device and uses a trick to hide three of them from your notification shade. Instead of shutting down their player service when you pause and navigate away the way that Play Music does, they leave the player service running permanently and force you to open the app and choose an explicit \"Quit\" option from the menu. You can't swipe to scroll between tabs.  The 1.5 update was a step in the right direction but it has a long way to go.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373841435540,"rating":3,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOEUhfUAwn5CgSaC2r3PvhaehGVzOHOgAAEF7uej-qVrhFbYVwqYiDy3nGfIUmuNe6UDNVJLJa0dDNBRgCY"},{"text":"Random playing?\tAfter the latest update it plays on it's own.

Overall, I have no complaints about the usability of the app. The playback functions work really well. My big issue right now is that the stats are saved to the app, not your account. I enjoy looking at the stats to see which achievements I've gotten, how many hours I've listened to, etc. Earlier this week, I restored my Galaxy Nexus to factory defaults and all of my stats in the Audible app were reset. When I received the update to the app today, my stats were reset once again. This is a big annoyance.  Audible, store these stats to the account so that they will transfer from device to device and still be present after upgrades. If that were to be fixed, this would be a 5 star app without any question. With this flaw, I have to give it 3 stars.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373686729968,"rating":3,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOHqnys8VdC40yDyaIvZ_hDgcZ_wc-4Zy6Xi6d-B8Blm9vL5Aco35Sd59xvR4QEH9mWoepNxx95eZrkkHYQ"},{"text":"Great app!\tGreat app!","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373686232371,"rating":4,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOGRzJDBF7ynmCiMhkfvn1b0ZKJIBGJWeHb9m1gs4GoKIN9aEp4yUPw939WwHXpHRla3tH79eGJokFamyuU"},{"text":"this app is the most awesome ever\tI am on a fixed income  but I will keep it as long as I can to finish my books  it breaks my heart .","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373685563631,"rating":5,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOH-wlDEvDDO2zajTpoNo1V7nwSH6BNbEZQkNNRNL_mWCJiNVq42z0d3q0sDEW2KLLh1GLfkkd_BlU64V8o"},{"text":"Dislike new interface\tComplete rewrite of the user interface and it's terrible!","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373683704472,"rating":1,"authorId":"cid-lg:AOqpTOGaNEo1geJQ5KGLGAZqnuZ7OqzO5cyhUFy_a6Yo5c--1n0ZCwRvsttWtP329EfLD3QPgjm1bVG1qu8PL9g"},{"text":"Charges you multiple times for a single book.

You definitely took some steps in the right direction by following the Android guidelines more closely (the user of the up button, tabs, etc...)   However, here's a few complaints:  The Cloud | Device tab navigation is confusing. I think Google Play Music does a good job of addressing this use case. They have a spinner with two options: All Music | On Device. I worked on the Kindle Fire HD, and I always hated how we present \"cloud\" and \"device\", when cloud is a superset of device. Also, most users don't have a concept of \"cloud\", \"All\" is much clearer.  No need to have \"Quit Application\" in the menu. Maybe for really old devices, but not on ICS+.  A drawer would be awesome. Checkout the new DrawerLayout, it's pretty sweet. For the love of god do not use the drawer that the Kindle Reader app uses. Main reason I say this is Spinners are clunky and you have too many views for tabs. A drawer would allow users to get back to their library in a consistent way from anywhere in the app.  Send me a message in Google+ if you want to talk more.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373642730102,"rating":3,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOH9aMA-w1jyxthylK5cOcDxr00KLrpydPGfhkt3r1aWpo7YeMIdfYVRiqm_N146qVnMOojHRzar9pK9ABI"},{"text":"I love this update!","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1373642402077,"rating":5,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOHXjUotbTndhTUF21Clvc6LCxaHZ6H8rbg-2FMDIjIFyacEtvtJE54wqDKH0XcDlLFbwkSUISDJyAI9ZJE"},{"text":"Nicely done\tThe old app was functional.

The way the UI elements move around makes the app hard to use. I wish there were a setting in the app to prevent it from rotating.  Also, the slide-up button bar at the bottom is annoying because sometimes I'll mean to hit the skip-back button, but the bar has been pulled up, so I end up hitting previous-chapter instead.  And the chapters of most of the books I have don't correspond to chapters on the device, so in some books skipping back one chapter takes you actually from chapter 7 to chapter 4, so you can have an hour or more of content to try and fast forward or rewind through to get back to where you were. A big improvement would be buttons that don't move around on the screen.  Some bread-crumb feature would be helpful so if I did accidentally hit next-chapter, I could easily jump back right to where I was previously.  It's too easy to hit the wrong buttons while driving down the road.

The service is fantastic. I love the way books are purchased, and the benefits for subscribing. That said, this app on Android has never improved one iota from the first day I used it. The UI for the player itself is fine. It's attractive and easy to use.  However, when you click the shopping cart icon, things become a mess. It launches a completely different user interface, which is basically a barely functional web wrapper around their existing web site. The app doesn't incorporate with the site, so when you move to the store, you will find yourself on the \"sign up today\" page, even if you already have an account. Honestly, why can't this app, at the very least, sign me in when transferring me to the store?  To make matters worse, as of the most recent update, I can't even FIND the login portion of the site through the app, so in order to buy books, I have to get on my PC, purchase them in a web browser, switch back to my android device, and click refresh on the library.

Unlike listening to books while driving I have been using my Audible reader to listen while at home.  The Audible reader lacks any ability to skip back to re-listen to parts of the book you missed while distracted or want to listen to again to get greater detail on a plot point. There is little to no fine control to skip forward or back, to reference points in the book to review, or to control your entry points to the audio track.  It is very basic, listen beginning to end, ringing the till for audible and onto the next book.  It may be the way I read, referencing back when necessary to get the finer points of the book I am reading.

Sometimes, however you have to exit the app. Not going to quit using it, but I wish they'd fix the little stuff.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1360827354746,"rating":3,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOH8GxbWdDj0HtLX67p9ReZlEuOr5oQ1Pf1Q4zf0JHaIdX_P7tCVL_z69KQhkctruQR3i1FJDMfC0py-VvQ"},{"text":"Audio","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1360826640649,"rating":5,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOEP29SrUPnkAUyloIqseBqZcZO0s-5RErEs2ymZhezQ5hmxJMJ-nUu_mUSsqBbdiGmvntaJKO-6AmJhDYk"},{"text":"Dumb\tWould have been a good app except for when I try to save it continuously says the app has stop working","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1360816867052,"rating":1,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOHtLkFwlYXkFCH3ByXVTUjZm2OCXLGh7gzKu3Tf2E4w_8DdgvkxSse4YURNqOT7OmVPUqtdfbeKCDX-j_A"},{"text":"0 star\tI wish, I can uninstall it and can give 0 star.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1360811975566,"rating":1,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOFbHnDsr7Cxc_6OPEua2XXtgQ16ZeX4DNEYjNCquInpH0wW57e4IQobIDOi2wh-u6c7TiUd0eyP3B3CLHo"},{"text":"Ok\tOk","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1360809552072,"rating":3,"authorId":"cid-gp:AOqpTOGwpQUrCXUfh25MriAZB-pFh9gC9LuD58YE9ObcSivKsjDI5Vho8cRcZypmG9dwC_tHXwS1ZrS2ST-oIaA"},{"text":"Thieves\tThey take money out of your account without authorization, and make the process of getting it back impossible.

This is all anyone ever wants in an app.   My biggest complaint, maybe my only complaint, may be the way that seeking through the book is handled.  1. Sometimes the book has to be already playing in order to directly select a chapter.  I don't know if this is a bug or something I'm not doing correctly but it should allow direct chapter selection and begin playing upon selecting the chapter.  2. This is a big one.  I often have to find my place, like when I fall asleep.  It would help it were easier to find my place.  The way that scrubbing works should be reversed from the way it is now to be correct.  I would rather see fine scrubbing when my finger is directly on the current location and faster seeking when I pull my finger away.  Exactly the opposite of how it is now.  3.

So unless you want to spend time moving books manually, not fast BTW,  the number of books on hand will be limited by the built-in memory of your device.

And given Android players are limited the the 2 LARGEST file formats, Audible is simply too frustrating to pay for every month.  As a nearly decade long subscriber I no longer se value in Audible with its current limitations, takes for all that Amazon.","authorName":"A Google User","creationTime":1351765163368,"rating":2,"authorId":"cid-lg:AOqpTOFC2a6GnpXmQHnkgjlBDOV_YKSFk06hKBUYj_lStfb77j3BSQJZA0cHpV8EK6aaOUvJ_vnZPImcw6rhmVI"},{"text":"Terrible\tIt won't even let me login in keeps coming up with an error msg, have re installed it twice and still not working looks like I shall be canceling my membership!

Used to have the occasional glitch but not in recent versions, plus I love that you can have it on several devices all synced, not to mention the huge variety of books available at a much cheaper price than through other sellers. Love the sleep timer, the security of having your library online for backup, and bookmark and notation feature. Would love it if members could earn free credits for certain amount of hours listened, books purchased, or reviews written. Overall though, the small monthly fee is way worth it, for example if you pay approx 14 dollars per month, you get the huge members discount on all titles plus a monthly credit to use on almost any title, so your 14 bucks gets you a book worth up to about 30 dollars.

My experience with Audible on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus is so poor that it is actually preventing me from moving to this as my primary phone.  Here's why:  1. When switching between the Audible app and others on the device, or transitioning between output methods (headphones, Bluetooth, car, etc) and audio ceases, when attempting to start playing again I receive an error \"Unable to play title\" in Audible.  I get this daily - multiple times.  The only way to restore the ability to play is to launch a task manager and KILL the Audible app, then re-open it, re-navigate to my book\/segment and start it again.  2. Navigation using the time-index slider bar seems to work 10% of the time.  I use the slider daily to visit specific time indexes, and most times no matter how or where I place my fingertip the bar is unresponsive.  It acts as if the hotspot for interface is the size of the point of  a needle.  The interface also looks poor on the G-Nex,  as it's clear it was designed for older, lower-res screens.
