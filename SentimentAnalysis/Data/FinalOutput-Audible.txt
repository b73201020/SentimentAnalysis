		'great until this last update EXCLAMATION i have been an audible platinum member for more than 7 years and have almost 250 titles in my library i absolutely love my audible app or i did before this last update would give it 5 stars instead of 3 if they fix these issues since the last update ive had several issues my stats on the app reset to 0 i lost all of my badges listening time and listening level i was on my way to appmaster some of my books will not download anymore i get a network error failed to download title error no matter when and how i try to download the books that used to download in multiple parts now download as 1 giant file this uses up my phones internal memory and slows down my phone i think this causes the following problems the app freezes up my phone after playing for an extended time the widget loses track of what im listening to shows no book and doesnt respond after the screen has been blank for an extended period of time my battery life has significantly decreased since the update im constantly having to re initialize the library and re load the book im listening to especially after pausing to take a phone call droid razr running ics'
		'awful update this app worked great before this update everytime i go to the app even while it is open in the bkgd it takes forever to load has to update my subscriptions etc everytime EXCLAMATION then like many are saying the app just starts playing when paused this can be quite embarrassing when it just starts in middle of a meeting it also doesnt always pause when i have an incoming call either it plays during my conversation EXCLAMATION please remove the update while you work these issues out '
		'ui update is only skin deep i was disappointed after installing this update the new ui appears to follow modern android design guidelines if you only look at screenshots but audible still has a ways to go before this is a well behaved android app audible starts four foreground services on your device and uses a trick to hide three of them from your notification shade instead of shutting down their player service when you pause and navigate away the way that play music does they leave the player service running permanently and force you to open the app and choose an explicit quit option from the menu you cant swipe to scroll between tabs the 1 5 update was a step in the right direction but it has a long way to go '
		'functional but needs design and layout update this app really needs an interface update some functions involve too many steps also the app need to be updated for android 4 x right now app looks and feels like it was designed for android 2 x which it was '

		'audible now owned by amazon is getting worse seriously this is your idea of an update well skip over the connecting to the internet on startup to sync positions and bookmarks with what none of my other audible players cowon d2 sandisk sansa connect to the internet so its only useful if you have multiple audible devices that sync well thatll be the amazon kindle then but not the new paperwhite one no headphone socket oh youre also no longer able to download individual parts of an audiobook this is a particularly good idea so instead of downloading one of the 7 parts of the book i wanted to listen to today it wants to download the full 1 gb but it wont tell you the size of the audiobook until you start to download it but what if you dont have the space available do you get a little warning nope just a random download failed error message app seems less stable than before as well now i liked audible hell ive pimped it around the internet enough over the last few years but this is starting to extract the urine take a look at poweramp if you want to know how to do an audio app an upgrade would have a lockscreen interface and more speed not this '
		'very basic has bugs can now log in galaxy s3 can now log in on my galaxy s3 have updated rating from 1 to 2 hope it wont delete my downloaded book like a previous reviewer compared to other audiobook players this is basic below average it can still play audio as did previous versions while downloading bugs a changing download settings from whole to part deletes downloaded book data b audio is missed with any phone sound notification c play options bar bypasses lock screen '

		'random app shutdown when playing this app in background or with the screen turned off the app stops playing at random intervals and when i open the app again it has to initialize and doesnt resume with the same book the only way to keep this working non stop on long drives is to leave it in foreground on screen with the screen powered up by the docking station for my droid razr maxx this is really annoying particularly when driving since i like to have a navigation or traffic app running i dont know for sure if this is a audible or an ice cream sandwich issue so i only dropped my review down to 3 stars if it turns out to be audible it should be a 1 or 2 star '

		'despite improvements the audible app is very unresponsive i hit the pause button on my lockscreen and cross my fingers hoping it will pause sometimes i wait and then the pause kicks in about 4 5 seconds later sometimes it never pauses if i hit it again it might pause correctly or it might stutter pausing and starting again perhaps repeatedly before settling on one of the two the start up time is improved its no longer as painful to start the app anymore but the loading screen is still ugly smiling models wearing some headphones is a pretty stupid idea what i want is instant startup and right into my book instead i get several images of people doing things and then i still have to press a tiny tiny play button and risk downloading the wrong book why cant this app just work two stars because it used to be worse believe it or not '

		'problems persist playback just keeps stopping randomly i guess the problem is that another app steals audio focus but it also stops when nothing audio related is used plus when an actual video or music starts audible just keeps playing lol please fix this its been a month like this already started around 9th sept getting really tired of this '

('unusable', 'unuseable')
		'mostly unuseable i find the app to be mostly unusable this is on a galaxy s iii it will work ok for a while then on the next play it will play for 4 seconds then pause press play pause play pause very frustrating this is with bluetooth as well as plugged in via usb '
		'shameful attention to detail amazon recently revamped the audible app for android i was hoping that they would fix a myriad of problems that made it almost unusable while the ui has drastically improved and now looks like it was made by a professional company it still lacks basic functionality like giving the user any sound indication that someone is calling i have missed so many calls by assuming that my phone will still ring while listening to this app the listening experience is fine but the app has left me underwhelmed '
		'seems to slow my phone down i like this app because i can listen to my books when im in the car on my nexus s and then smoothly continue from the same place when i get home on my galaxy tab however while running in the background the app seems to considerably slow down my nexus s to the point where its nearly unusable at times when i close the app the problem stops '
		'audible for android continual need to reboot phone nearly unusable '
