		'please add listen now in google play music soundhound please add a listen now in google play music option you used to support spotify and now you feature rdio but people want to make their own decisions i happen to use google play music all access because i like the service more on android since this is an android app it should support googles new music service in my opinion it is the best one available at the moment and spotify is also a great service only supporting rdio is cruel to users who do not want to pay for rdio other than that the app is amazing it typically finds all of my songs whether i am humming them listening to them or whatnot the lyrics that it displays is awesome and is a killer feature the app beats shaaam by miles and is unbelievable this app has a ton of potential and i think that it will increase in popularity but please please add the option to switch listening service the ability to connect this app with my seemingly infinite stash of music from google play music would make this app a five star app it should at least be available for users of soundhound infinity users we payed you in support please listen to us thanks for reading and hope this happens'

		'amazing EXCLAMATION have only just found this but have been on it all night EXCLAMATION been looking up information lyrics and even tour dates for artists i wanted to give this 5 stars but there are a few glitches when you click on buy it takes you to the american amazon no use if you live in the uk and shows you a load of artists youve never heard of EXCLAMATION you cant even see the artist you are interested in EXCLAMATION get fed up of the title pages displaying artists that i have absolutely no interest in it would be great if it could be customised to your favourite songs and artists also quite a few of the lyrics are wrong tried to sync with facebook and just got a load of error messages so am worried that all my info will be lost when i get a new tablet next month however this app is great fun to use and always amazes me when i attempt to mumble a few lines of a song and it gets it right EXCLAMATION good stuff '
		'amazing EXCLAMATION i can put it up to the radio and it will find the song and give me live lyrics to read EXCLAMATION i can also sing to it im a terrible singer and it will give me the correct songs EXCLAMATION my only problem is that it doesnt have some songs overall this is an amazing app EXCLAMATION '
